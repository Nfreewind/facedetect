facedetect
==========

A static library wrapper for OpenCV. Detect faces in YUV images and output a bitmap for the found area.

For ease of distribution, you may need to build OpenCV as static:
In OpenCV CMake, uncheck `BUILD_SHARD_LIBS` and `BUILD_WITH_STATIC_CRT`.

Other platform than **Windows** is not covered in this project.
