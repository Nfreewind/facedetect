Detect faces in YUV images and output a bitmap for the found area.\r\nRun the `detect` project as a demo.\r\n\r\n####Features:\r\n\r\n1.  preloaded both old/new cascade file\r\n2.  utility for YUV420/422 image/video input.\r\n3.  allow raw pointer input so that user do not have to construct a cv::Mat himself.\r\n4.  OpenCL classifier support\r\n\r\nOther platform than Windows is not tested.\r\n\r\nHint:\r\nFor ease of distribution, you may need to build OpenCV as static:\r\nIn OpenCV CMake, uncheck `BUILD_SHARD_LIBS` and `BUILD_WITH_STATIC_CRT`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
